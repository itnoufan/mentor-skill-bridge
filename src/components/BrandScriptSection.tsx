                You want to build a career you're proud of. You want to learn skills that actually 
                matter—skills that help you do your job well, get better opportunities, and feel 
                confident at work.

                But the truth is, it's hard to know where to start. There are so many courses out 
                there, and most of them don't teach what you actually need. You've wasted time on 
                lessons that didn't help. You've felt stuck, unsure of what skills will make a 
                real difference.

                <strong className="text-foreground">At Fit My Skill, we believe everyone deserves access to real, 
                job-ready skills.</strong> We know how frustrating it is to learn things that don't work in 
                real jobs. That's why we built a platform where working professionals teach the exact 
                skills they use every day.

                Here's how it works: First, you explore the skills that match your goals. Then, you 
                learn from mentors who actually work in the industry. Finally, you apply what you've 
                learned with confidence—in interviews, at work, and in your career.

                That's what Fit My Skill gives you.
